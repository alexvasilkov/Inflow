/**
 * An `Inflow` is a way to use cached data more effectively, automatically keep it up to date by
 * refreshing from a remote source and to observe refresh state.
 *
 * **Cache**
 *
 * Cached data can be observed with [data] flow. If [data] flow has at least one subscriber the
 * `Inflow` will make sure to automatically refresh the cache when it expires.
 * See [data] method for more details.
 *
 * Refresh can also be started manually by calling [load] method, as an option it can be done in
 * a suspending manner using [join()][InflowDeferred.join] or [await()][InflowDeferred.await] on the
 * result of the [load] call.
 *
 * **State**
 *
 * Refresh state can be observed using [state] flow.
 *
 * The [state] flow will emit each time the loading is started or finished and can optionally
 * emit an intermediate progress state. It will also emit the most recent error happened during the
 * last loading request (see [State.Idle.Error]).
 *
 * **Usage**
 *
 * An `Inflow` is created using [inflow][inflow.inflow] method and configured using [InflowConfig].
 *
 * A simple usage can look like this:
 *
 * ```
 * val companies = inflow<List<Companies>?> {
 *     data(
 *         cache = dao.getCompaniesList()
 *         writer = dao::saveCompaniesList
 *         loader = { api.loadCompaniesList() }
 *     )
 * }
 *
 * companies.data()
 *     .onEach(::showCompanies)
 *     .launchIn(lifecycleScope)
 *
 * companies.refreshing()
 *     .onEach(::showLoadingState)
 *     .launchIn(lifecycleScope)
 * ```
 *
 * **See [InflowConfig] for all the available configuration options.**

     * subscribers. Thus no extra cache readings will be done for all subsequent subscribers and
     * they will immediately receive the most recent data.

     * Original cache will be unsubscribed after predefined timeout since last active subscriber is
     * unsubscribed (see [InflowConfig.keepCacheSubscribedTimeout]).

     * screens, etc.

     * loader configured with [InflowConfig.data] and according to the expiration policy set
